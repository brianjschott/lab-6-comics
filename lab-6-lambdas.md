\cf0 - Display the median hero for each decade for the Overstreet Price Guide\
- Display only heroes that were in the top 10% of the overall values of eBay sales in the 90s\

- Create new columns that reflect the heritage pricing for each decade, adjusted for inflation. You can find inflation adjustment with the formula [(Updated Price - Original price) / Original price] * 100\
- Propose your own research question, and - using a lambda function - answer it. You do not need to perform a visualization for this activity.}
